3. **Truly minimal** — Feature creep in all major apps
4. **Speed** — Bloat makes competitors slow
5. **Privacy** — All harvest user data

## Positioning Strategy

- **Radical Simplicity** — Anti-feature-bloat
- **Privacy-First** — No account, no tracking
- **Ad-Free Forever** — Premium supports development
- **Offline-Native** — Works without internet

### Messaging
- "Recipes without the noise"
- "Your recipes, your device, your way"
- "Finally, an app that just works"

### Target User Quotes
> "I just want the ingredients and steps. I don't need your life story." — Reddit r/cooking

> "Why do recipe apps need my location, contacts, and push notifications?" — Twitter

> "I'm tired of waiting for ads to load while I'm hungry." — App Store review

## Conclusion

Direct competitors are either:
1. **Freemium with ads** — Bad experience
2. **Expensive** — Barriers to entry
3. **Feature-bloated** — Overwhelming

RecipeClean wins by being:
- **Simple** — Just recipes
- **Fast** — No bloat
- **Private** — No account
- **Fair** — Ad-free with optional premium

This positions us as the anti-hero in a crowded, ad-heavy market.
