# RecipeClean Launch Thread

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
🧑‍🍳 I built a recipe app because I'm tired of every recipe app existing being terrible.

Ads. Account requirements. Blog stories before the recipe. Loading screens.

So I made RecipeClean.

A thread 🧵👇

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
Every recipe app follows the same pattern:

1. Show me an ad
2. Make me create an account
3. Make me wait for a loading screen
4. Show me a 2,000 word blog post
5. Finally show me the recipe

I just want the ingredients and steps. Why is that so hard?

## Tweet 3 (Solution)

✓ No ads. Ever.
✓ No account required.
✓ Opens instantly.

## Tweet 5 (Privacy)
The best part? No account required.

Free version: unlimited recipes, core features.

## Tweet 7 (Why)
Why build another recipe app?

Because the market is dominated by:
- Ad-heavy free apps
- Expensive one-time purchases
- Feature-bloated everything

There's room for an app that just... works.

## Tweet 8 (Launch)
RecipeClean is now available on iOS and Android.

Download, add your first recipe, and start cooking.

No account. No ads. No friction.
